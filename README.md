# Standford University Machine Learning program by Andrew NG

Please find in this repo a detail of my personal training taking the Machine Learning program by Andrew NG @Stanford University.
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition.including: 

##  Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks)
##  Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
##  Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).
