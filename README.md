# Standford University Machine Learning program by Andrew NG

Please find in this repo a detail of my personal training taking the Machine Learning program by Andrew NG @Stanford University.
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. The programming assignement are done in Matlab and includes : 

##  Supervised learning 

Parametric/non-parametric algorithms

Support vector machines

Kernels

Neural Networks

##  Unsupervised learning

Clustering

Dimensionality reduction

Recommender systems

Deep learning

##  Best practices in machine learning

Bias/variance theory

Innovation process in machine learning and AI
